# SMILES Prediction App 🖼️🔍

This Streamlit web application predicts the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation for PNG images of chemical structures.

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Upload an Image**: Click on the "Upload a PNG Image" button and select a PNG image of a chemical structure.
2. **Predict SMILES**: Once the image is uploaded, click on the "Predict SMILES" button to generate the SMILES notation for the uploaded image.
3. **View Prediction**: The predicted SMILES notation will be displayed below the uploaded image.
